# Jabber.ru

This repository contains js code and some static files for https://jabber.ru website. Development version is at https://beta.jabber.ru

To build it for your own use, you should have node installed.
Then commit following commands (not verified):

```bash
git clone https://github.com/oxpa/www.jabber.ru 
cd www.jabber.ru
npm i 
node_modules/.bin/webpack
mkdir public
cp -ar static/* public/
cp -ar compiled/* pulic/
rm public/main.js public/fonts.js 
```
Public will contain directory suitable to serve with web server.

Result is distributed across two directories: `compiled` and `compiledos`. 
The latter will have only two files suitable for production deployment.
